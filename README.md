# Auto-Splitter for Dexter Stardust: Adventures In Outer Space

## Features

Timer starts when you access Episode 0.  
Splits when finishing an Episode (at the point of returning back to the Main Menu - not at the To Be Continued screen).  
Resets the timer at any point you decide to head back to the Main Menu throughout the run that's not at the point of the End of Episodes.  


This autosplitter logs when the run starts, splits and resets which can be seen with softwares like Trace Spy.  
File logging can be achieved if needed. Further logging update to possibly include which chapter split into.
